Subject: [PATCH 5/6] MINOR: [Python] try harder to set up s3_server fixture
 (#41754)

In conda-forge, when running the aarch tests in emulation, we regularly run into the [issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/pyarrow-feedstock/issues/117) that the fixture setup fails. Extending the timeouts fixes this. Since it only happens once per session, it doesn't hurt to take a little bit more time.
