Subject: [PATCH 8/8] GH-46159: [CI][C++] Stop using possibly missing
 boost/process/v2.hpp on boost 1.88 and use individual includes (#46160)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

### Rationale for this change

Similar to https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/46113 but for boost v2.
The files `v1.hpp` and `v2.hpp` have been removed from `include/boost/process` on `1.88`:
https://github.com/boostorg/process/tree/develop/include/boost/process
but were available on `1.87`:
https://github.com/boostorg/process/blob/boost-1.87.0/include/boost/process/v1.hpp
https://github.com/boostorg/process/blob/boost-1.87.0/include/boost/process/v2.hpp

### What changes are included in this PR?

Stop using include for possible missing file and add individual includes

### Are these changes tested?

Via CI

### Are there any user-facing changes?

No
